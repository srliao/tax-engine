Building a basic tax calculation engine - mostly for doing calculations for the purpose of tax planning i.e. simulations etc... It won't be a 100% accurate thing for tax fillings or anything like that since there's too many exceptions to cover

Roughly taxes payable in Canada is calculated as follows

1. Calculate taxable income
2. Calculate non refundable tax credits
3. Calculate basic taxes owing - provincial/federal = some rate * the taxable income calculated in 1. above; can be expressed in a math formula so not much complications here
4. Calculating income taxes payable = amount in 3 minus amount in 2 but cannot be < 0, +/- any other refundable tax credits
5. Calculating balance owing = income taxes payable +/- other taxes payable such as surtax, taxes already paid, any cpp/ei owing etc...

Each of these steps includes many substeps/components that are subject to change and/or addition of new substeps all the time. For example, in 1. you have employment income, self employed income, rrsp, investment etc... each of which are obviously subject to their own calculations and depending on the tax payer may or may not be present.

Different substeps may also have dependecies in other substeps that are not in the same
main step; For example a tax credit may depend on how much cpp is paid in employment income etc...



Idea for input:

wage: 10,000
cpp: 10,000
ei: 10,000

or maybe by slips?
